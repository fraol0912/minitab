## Running the website

1. Install packages using (yarn/npm/pnpm).
2. Use your package manger to run the `start` script.

## Requirements

This code expects an environment variable called `CLIENT_ID` to be defined. To provide this environment variable create a file called `.env` containing the following content:

```dotenv
CLIENT_ID="<CLIENT-ID>"
```

You can get your client id from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers).
